This website allows users to "buy" and "sell" stocks. A new user will register for a username and password
and automatically be directed to the homepage where it will list out the amount of cash available,
the amount invested and a list of all the individual stocks, prices, shares and totals.

A user will be able to get quotes for a stock and buy and sell stocks. Checks have been implemented for
the quote, buy and sell tabs to ensure a user inputs the correct stock symbol, the correct amount of shares
to buy/sell (a positive integer), and that a user does not over buy or over sell.

The history tab lists out every single transaction a user has committed with date and time, the stock bought/sold,
the price bought/sold at and the number of shares.
